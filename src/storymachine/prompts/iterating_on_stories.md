<operations>
These are the typical operations on the stories while iterating on them, and the usual reasons for them.. Interpret the feedback below in terms of these operations where possible.

- Break down further: usually because it's a large piece, or has multiple values associated with it
- Merge stories: they're too small, or create the same value
- Prioritise, and reprioritise: based on business value or dependencies
- Change wording: usually to convey the business value better
- Remove: not relevant, or duplicate
- Add missing stories: somehow missed it in the breakdown
- Group them with a prefix: to categorise
