<considerations>
- Verifiable by a product manager. So, no technical terms, preferably a blackbox test. Domain based usage words, not UI or technical words.
- Write ACs that cover the happy path, and obvious edge cases, don't look to be exhaustive.
- Use <Given> <when> <then> as format where possible, but generally keep it readable in simple words.
- Write one AC per scenario.
- Be specific, use example values that we would later put into automated tests. Don't use vague words like fast, easy, etc.
- If there are many ACs, that's okay, write them anyway, and we can split the story later on.
